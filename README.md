## Overview  
This repository accompanies my academic seminar work and presentation on biologically inspired visual perception models.  
It includes a literature-based analysis (papers 1–4) and an applied experiment based on **Model #5 (ConvNet5)** from *Cohen-Duwek et al., 2021* exploring architectural and parameter sensitivity in Laplacian-based image reconstruction.  

 **Supervisor:** Dr. Hadar Cohen-Duwek | The Open University of Israel | September 2025

## Research Aim  
Developing **computational models inspired by human visual perception** and **neuromorphic vision**, combining biologically plausible components such as **Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)** and **event cameras**.  
The goal is to bridge the gap between **limited, dynamic retinal input** and the **stable, complete visual experience** observed in human perception.  


## Repository Contents
