# Implementation Notes

\- The applied experiment reproduces and extends \*\*Model #5 (ConvNet5)\*\* with several architectural and loss-function variants.  

\- Results include PSNR, SSIM, and MSE comparisons across variants (e.g., ReLU, Mish, BatchNorm, Dilated Convs).  

\- Training was performed using the **[N-Caltech101 Event Dataset](https://github.com/NBELab/CVPR-2021-W/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#dataset)**, maintaining the setup described in *Cohen-Duwek et al., 2021*.
